While the data has been regularly updated, the team has yet to implement a dashboard or sophisticated reporting process. City officials have a number of questions on the program, so your first task on the job is to build a set of data reports to provide the answers.

There are two datasets that were used in the analysis

Ride Data from New Jersey (September 2019)

Ride Data from New Jersey (September 2020)

The selected data was used to compare usage before and after the first wave of COVID.

Conclusion:

In contrast to Sept 2019 data, usage has increased dramatically for Sept 2020, especially for Generation Z.

Average Trips have doubled from 1,500 mins to 3,000 mins, with the exception of Generation Z, whose average trip is 15,000 mins

On weekends, bikes are mostly used from 12 am to 6 pm, while on weekdays the rush hours are 8 am and 5-6pm.

However there is a significant increase in usage in both Subcribers and Customers between 9am and 3pm. 

Grove St Path continues to be the most popular drop-off destination. 

The only decline would be the popularity in  End Stations. In 2019 there were 68 Most popular End Stations in use vs the current 2 Most popular End Stations.

The CitiRide Program continues to be popular across all ages, no real significant difference between genders with the exception of Generation Z where men use the program more than women.
